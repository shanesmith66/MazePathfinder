# Maze Generation and Pathfinding Algorithm Visualizer
Generates a maze using 5 different algorithms (Unless the user wants to draw their own barricades). Finds path from A to B using 5 different pathfinding algorithms.
- Based on/Inspired by TechWithTims A* Pathfinding Visualizer

# CONTROLS
H - Print help in console, showing these controls

C - Clear Grid

### MAZE GENERATION 

1 - Generate Maze Using Random DFS Algorithm

2 - Generate Maze Using Prims Algorithm

3 - Generate Maze Using Kruskals Algorithm

4 - Generate Maze Using Aldous Broder Algorithm

5 - Generate Maze Using Hunt and Kill Algorithm

N - Do not generate maze, draw own barricades using Left and Right Click

### AFTER MAZE GENERATED/NO MAZE

Left click #1: Pick Start

Left click #2: Pick End

**IF NO MAZE:** Any subsequent left clicks will draw barricades

Right click to erase barricade/start/end

### PATHFINDING ALGORITHMS - Once start and end defined

Q - A* Pathfinding

W - Dijkstra's Algorithm

E - Breadth-First Search

R - Depth-First Search

T - Greedy Best-First Search

# RANDOM DFS
